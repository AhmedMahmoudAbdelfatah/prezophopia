### React.js

React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the DOM as changes occur. React is used extensively throughout the Prezophopia project to create the various UI elements and components.

### Axios

Axios is a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests. It simplifies the process of making API requests by providing an easy-to-use interface for handling responses and errors. Axios is used in the Prezophopia project to make requests to the backend API, including retrieving post data and user information.

### React-Router-Dom

React-Router-Dom is a routing library for React applications. It allows developers to define routes and navigation within a React application, making it easier to handle multiple pages or views. React-Router-Dom is used in the Prezophopia project to handle navigation between different views, including the login page, user profile page, and post creation page.

### HTML5

HTML5 is the latest version of the HTML markup language and provides new features for structuring web pages. HTML5 is used in the Prezophopia project to structure the various elements of the website, including headers, paragraphs, and forms.

### CSS3
